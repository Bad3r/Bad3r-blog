The goal of this blog is to keep track of resources i use/used to learn form as well as a personal reference for future me. also to force me to actively think about the various concepts i learn and information i gather.

also hopeful it might help others at some point, like many other blogs and sites that i read to get a starting point on various subjects that relates to computer science and security.

On social media, we may share our own thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information.
