# About my Blog

![](https://github.com/Bad3r/Bad3r-blog/tree/501930b64c6ef02b40e53942547eaa8a7be319a6/%7B%7B)

The goal of this blog is to keep track of resources i use to learn form as well as a personal reference for future me. As well as to force me to actively think about the various concepts i learn and information i gather.

also i hope it might help others at some point, like many other blogs and sites that i read to get a starting point on various subjects that relates to computer science and security.

## Important:

 Please note that this site is work under progress. Am not very familiar with HTML and am working on learning more about it and more about Markdown.
