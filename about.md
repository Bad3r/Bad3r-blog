## About my Blog

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/about_top.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

The goal of this blog is to keep track of resources i use to learn form as well as a personal reference for future me.
As well as to force me to actively think about the various concepts i learn and information i gather.

also i hope it might help others at some point, like many other blogs and sites that i read to get a starting point on various subjects that relates to computer science and security.
